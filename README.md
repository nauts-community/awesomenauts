# Awesomenauts

Awesomenauts is a 2D multiplayer online battle arena developed by Dutch video game development company Ronimo Games.

**DISCLAIMER:** This repository is not provided by the developer Ronimo games, it is created by a the game's community.

**DISCLAIMER:** The economics of the game is unknown to us, thus we are making an educated guess and proposing handling

## Purpose of this repository

This repository is used to track current bugs in the Awesomenauts game and to provide reasoning to it's release as Free (as in freedom) software that doesn't have a bad influence on the game revenue to justify it's release.

### Current game's status

As of 30/12/2020-EU awesomenauts has been unmaintained since 2018.

The community has made an educated guess that the game is going to be eventually removed from the steam store and from the public reach.

### How is this going to help the game?

By releasing the game as [Free Software](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/freesoftware.html) it can be either community maintainer or community assisted which would allow us to study the source code, modify and redistribute it with the ultimate goal to fix the tracked bugs, provide more content, new maps, new awesomenauts, new mechanics and generally support the game in growing.

### Why is redistribution important?

Free Software's core principle is to allow redistribution so that the functions can be peer-reviewed and outsourced for maintenance with a clear specified abstract allowing the developers to write the software off of library design while **reducing** the maintenance cost and the need to "reinvent the wheel".

### Economical state of the game

The game is currently free2play with non-required option to purchase cosmetic items and awesomenauts (the in-game characters) that can be also purchased using in-game currency.

It has been understood that this is the main method for the game to generate revenue.

#### Music

Music is playing for each awesomenaut (in-game character) and in the whole game making it an important part of the source-code.

We assume that this music is copyrighted material that is helping the game to generate revenue and thus proposing to allow the end-users to purchase rights to modify and redistribute the modified copies of the music for commercial use and with license allowing contributions to the upstream.

Optionally invidually monetizing the rights to redistribute and modify.

Optionally releasing the music as-is under a license that allows modification and redistribution.

#### Awesomenauts (in-game characters)

Each awesomenaut is interpreted as digital art, we assume that this is important part of the game to generate revenue.

We are proposing allowing the modifications for the purpose of contribution to the upstream.

#### Arts

Whole game is interpreted as a well polished digital art creating a unique atmosphere and feel and so we are assuming it being important part used to generate the revenue.

We are proposing to allow modification for the purpose of contribution to the upstream and allowing the end-users to purchase rights to modify and to purchase merchandise to support the game.

#### Game engine

The game engine is used on other romino's games we assume it being taken as important part of the game being able to generate revenue.

Unless there are patented technologies used in the game engine that are holding a value as an intellectual property then the game engine should be released as Free Software so that we can work on the game and develop our games on that engine which gives us motivation to maintain it, passively improve it and implement new features in it depending on the current code quality and made abstracting.

Otherwise we are making the educative guess that the invidual functions and primitives used for the game engine do not generate revenue for the developer and limits the revenue it can create.

By releasing the engine we can also help in improving other romino's games.

Practical use of open-sourcing the game engine would be on an example of Epic Games, inc. using Unreal engine that has it's source code provided on https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine (requires special agreement designed to preserve the company's economy.)

We are also making an educative guess that the functions and primitives used to create the engine are most likely reimplementing or using 3rd party libraries that are already known to the public or licensed as Free Software and as such it's combination should by theoretically harmful to the romino's economy to be kept as closed-source since it is not directly used to generate the revenue.

Note that we do not need the game engine as in the worst case scenario we can interpret our own user interface to work with the game files or write the source code without the game engine.

#### Other intellectual property

To be determined as not enough information has been provided to make an educative guess.
